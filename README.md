This code base is from the pytorch implementation of SINDy Autoencoders from the following github: https://github.com/bolee02/cs4240-research-reproduction

The original tensorflow implementatino by Kathleen Champion is also linked here: https://github.com/kpchamp/SindyAutoencoders
# Important
* End-to-end training script and evaluation for Nonlinear Pendulum can be found in SINDy_Autoencoder.ipynb
* Evaluation for Reaction-Diffusion system located in evaluate_rd.ipynb

# How to use in Google Colab
1. Upload SINDy_Autoencoder.ipynb to Google Colab
2. Upload params.json to colab (change to your liking)
3. Run all code blocks
